# learn_ascii_demo
An HTML5/js demo application for kids to learn a bit about ASCII

This is a browser-based "kiosk" app where kids learning ASCII can enter their name in ASCII code (using a numeric keypad) and add their name to the list of other kids who have completed this exercise.

I wrote this app for use in the "Computer Science" display at a local elementary school science expo day.

For best results, the kiosk should be equipped with only a numeric keypad - this prevents the entering of letters, etc. You can buy USB numeric keyboards at most office supply stores.

The included worksheet is intended as a handout that should be completed before using the kisok app. The worksheet contains the printable ASCII table of letters as well as some common punctuation. This worksheet is in "flat open-document" format and must be edited with LibreOffice (http://www.libreoffice.org)
