# learn_ascii_demo
An HTML5/js demo application for kids to learn a bit about ASCII

This is a browser-based "kiosk" app where kids learning ASCII can enter their name in ASCII code (using a numeric keypad) and add their name to the list of other kids who have completed this exercise.

I wrote this app for use in the "Computer Science" display at a local elementary school science expo day.

For best results, the kiosk should be equipped with only a numeric keypad - this prevents the entering of letters, etc. You can buy USB numeric keyboards at most office supply stores.
